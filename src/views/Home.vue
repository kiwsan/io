      description="Hi, Iâ€™m Ekkchai. Nice to meet you. Since beginning my journey as a web developer nearly 4 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my chops."
